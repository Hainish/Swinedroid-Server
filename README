Requirements:

	* CherryPy >= 3.1
	* pyOpenSSL
	* Python XML support
	* Python mySQL support

Configuration:

	1. Run "./makecert.sh" - this will generate a self-signed certificate.  You can also generate your own certificate, if you like.  It should be noted that a this time the swinedroid client connection is secure but *not* authenticated. 
	
	2. Change swinedroid.conf to match your mySQL settings.

	3. Change cherrypy.conf to whatever port you want the server to run on, or leave the default 6060.

Running:

	1. Run "./server.py".  If you want it to run as a daemon, run "nohup ./server.py &".
